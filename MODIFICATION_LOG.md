## [Date: 2024-06-09] Admin Authentication Update for Dashboard Access

- Replaced Supabase-based admin authentication in `AdminDashboard.tsx` with a localStorage session check.
- Now, only users who have logged in via `AdminLogin.tsx` (using the hardcoded password) can access the admin dashboard.
- If the session is missing or expired, users are redirected to the homepage.
- This is a temporary solution until Supabase Auth is fully integrated for admin access.

## [2024-05-31] Switched Admin Session to Supabase Auth

- Admin login and dashboard now use Supabase Auth session instead of localStorage.
- Only the pre-approved admin email (admin@example.com) can access the admin panel.
- All localStorage session logic removed from admin login and dashboard.

## [2024-05-31] Centered Navbar Contents

- Centered all contents of the Navbar (logo, navigation links, buttons) horizontally in the middle of the page for both desktop and mobile layouts.
- Adjusted flex and container classes in `src/components/Navbar.tsx` to remove right-shifting and ensure proper centering.

## [2024-05-31] Renamed Supabase Storage Bucket

- Changed all references of the Supabase Storage bucket from `private_documents` to `privatedocuments` (removed underscore) throughout the codebase to match the new bucket name.
